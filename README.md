# IBM_Machine_Learning_Assignment Rain Prediction Classification

The original source of the data is Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and the latest data can be gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/.

The dataset to be used has extra columns like 'RainToday' and our target is 'RainTomorrow', which was gathered from the Rattle at https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData

This dataset contains observations of weather metrics for each day from 2008 to 2017. The weatherAUS.csv dataset includes the following fields:

We will use some of the ML algorithms on specifically:

Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM

We will evaluate our models using:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
Finally, we will use our models to generate the report at the end.
